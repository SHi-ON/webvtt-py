0.4.1 (24-12-2017)
------------------

* Support for saving cue identifiers

0.4.0 (18-09-2017)
------------------

The main goal of this release is a refactor of the WebVTT parser to be able to parse easier and give support to
new features of the format.

New features:

* Support for cue identifiers
* Support for parsing WebVTT captions with comments
* Support for parsing WebVTT captions with Style blocks
* Support for BOM in caption files

* Ignore empty captions in SRT format

Other:

* Refactored WebVTT parser

0.3.3 (23-08-2017)

The text for the caption is now returned clean (tags removed). The cue text could contain tags like:
* timestamp tags: *<00:19.000>*
* class tags: *<c.classname>text</c>*
* and others...
**Important**: It currently removes any tag present in the cue text. For example <b> would be removed.

Also a new attribute is available on captions to retrieve the text without cleaning tags: **raw_text**
